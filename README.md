# AMIEvalita
This is the code used to create the model for our participation in the Evalita 2020 shared task on  Automatic Misogyny Identification. 

We focus on subtask A ---Misogyny and  Aggressive Behaviour Identification--- which aims at detecting whether a tweet  in Italian is misogynous and, if so, whether it is aggressive. Rather than  building two different models, one for misogyny and one for aggressiveness identification, we handle the problem as one single multi-label classification 
task, considering three classes: non-misogynous, non-aggressive misogynous and  aggressive misogynous.
